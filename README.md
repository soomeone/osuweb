# Osu web
Making osu available everywhere...

I'm trying to make a 100% javascript build of osu. Currently Maps can be loaded and be (auto)played, but without sliders (since I have trouble understanding the syntax). Feel free to make corrections.

# How to develop
To start coding on your own, just download the files and put it into a php-capable webserver.
Please note that this project isn't meant to be hosted anywhere else than on the webserver that I'll set up, once this enters a stable stage. But naturally everyone that contributes will be meant in the credits (and more :) ).
